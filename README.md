# OhmSweetOhm
Ohm Sweet Ohm is a smart home monitoring system for RVs and campers that monitors various aspects of mobile home living.
These real time readings are then sent to webapp that is displayed on a local screen. Currently the readings on the 
webapp are generated randomly but will soon be readings from sensors around the camper or RV. These sensors include
a water pressure sensor for clean water output, an ultrasonic sensor for the wastewater tank, an air quality sensor 
which reads the air quality inside the vehicle, and a gas pressure sensor which reads the pressure from the propane
tank. There are also buttons to toggle the lights and extend or retract the awning.
